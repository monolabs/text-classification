31163,"based electronics-disrupting emp attack , in addition to direct warhead ground blasts.the official communist party newspaper , rodong sinmun , publish a report monday on the emp might of nuclear weapon , outline an electromagnetic pulse ( emp ) attack produce by detonate a nuclear warhead in space . in general , the strong electromagnetic pulse generate from nuclear bomb explosion between 30 kilometer and 100 kilometer [ 18.6 mile and 62 mile ] above the ground can severely impair electronic device , electric machine , and electromagnetic grid , or destroy electric cable and safety device , say the article author by kim songwon , dean of kim chaek university of technology in pyongyang . the discovery of the electromagnetic pulse a a source of high yield in the high-altitude nuclear explosion test process have give it recognition a an important strike method , he stated.the official discussion by north korea of plan to conduct emp strike will likely fuel debate over the threat . former cia director james woolsey have say north korea be capable of orbit an emp nuclear weapon in a satellite.some liberal arm control advocate have dismiss the emp threat from pyongyang a far-fetched , such a arm control advocate jeffrey lewis , who in april dismiss the threat of an emp attack by laugh at a reporter s question . this be the favorite nightmare scenario of a small group of very dedicated people , he tell npr.disclosure of north korea s intention to use it nuclear force for emp attack come a you.s . intelligence agency be continue to analyze the late underground nuclear test by north korea on sept. 3 that the regime say be it first hydrogen bomb explosion.senior administration official say initial assessment of the nuclear blast in northeastern north korea indicate it be the large test detonation so far , and much large than an underground test carry out last year . it be the regime s sixth nuclear test.you.s . nuclear technician have not make a definitive conclusion about the specific of the device . specialist be try to determine if the test involve a hydrogen bomb , a pyongyang assert , or a device design for emp attack . they be also assess whether the test use boost fission technology.hydrogen bomb be advanced device that use a two-stage explosion process to produce a massive explosion . boost fission device be less sophisticated technologically and require more nuclear fuel . we re highly confident this be a test of an advanced nuclear device and what we ve see so far be not inconsistent with north korea s claim , a you.s . intelligence official said.however , a final conclusion on the type and yield of the blast be not expect for several day . data from the test be be analyze by nuclear weapon expert at los alamos national laboratory in new mexico.also , the large explosion perhaps more than 100 kiloton , or the equivalent of 100 ton of tn likely produce significant venting of radioactive particle into the air.special you.s . intelligence aircraft , include the wc-135 nuclear sniffer jet , be conduct flight near the test zone to gather sample of particle from the test.experts be say an emp attack by n korea be a very real and dark possibilityaccording to the business insider , some expert believe that the more realistic threat at this point in time be an emp attack . to make that happen , all north korea have to do be launch a low-yield nuclear missile from a submarine , ship , or even by balloon and explode it at high altitude , above the atmosphere.the potential result : a blackout of the eastern grid that supply 75 % of power to the united states.if an emp attack do take place , it would be beyond anything we have see before . the commission to assess the threat to the united state from electromagnetic pulse attack , which be establish by congress in 2001 , estimate that within 12 month follow a nationwide blackout , up to 90 % of the u population could perish from starvation , disease , and societal breakdown . electronic armageddonin practical term , a catastrophic blackout would be worst in city , because it would instantly deprive the population of access to drinking water , refrigeration , heat , air conditioning , and telecommunication . food store would be loot within a matter of day , and gas station would cease to function without electricity.without internet access and power , all commerce and advance method of communication would stop . there would be no tv , radio , phone . credit card transaction and cash withdrawal at bank would be impossible . paper money would become worthless , and bitcoin would cease to exist , along with the stock market.newt gingrich , speaking at the senate committee on energy and natural resource earlier this month , say an emp attack would send u back to the 18th century . but that s not the only problem . if no outside help arrives , within day , chaos begin to reign . civilization be a rather thin veneer that human have acquire over century , a mask cover our hard-wired survival instinct . once the mask slip , it could mean the end of the world a we know it.we be ill-prepared for an emp attackus politician and major utility have kick the can down the road when it come to emp preparation . edison electric estimate that shield transformer for the u grid system could cost $ 20 billion.granted , american power company have be study way to protect our electronic grid against attack , but tangible result be slow in coming.the only current option after an emp attack would be to replace damage or destroy transformer . however , say scott aaronson , manage director for cyber and infrastructure security at edison electric , replacement for those transformer must be procure from foreign supplier , which could take up to 18 months.peter vincent pry , leader of the task force on national and homeland security , believe north korea be closer to launch an emp attack than many analyst believe . he want congress to work harder and cut the red tape to allow the innovation necessary to mitigate the threat.in pry s opinion , an emp attack would ultimately kill more american than a direct nuclear blast could . his book , the long sunday , describe several plausible emp attack scenarios.pry think that the first nation to use nuclear weapon today even a rogue state like north korea or iran will immediately become the most feared and credible nuclear power in the world , a formidable force to be reckon with , and perhaps the dominant actor in a new world order . be there a sensible way to

the current situation at al-tanf simply contradict that statement.since that time , both britain and the u have be slowly ramp up their presence in syria , ostensibly to fight isi . but by repeatedly strike at syrian government force the single most effective fight force against isi the u and britain be actually help isi to achieve it objectives.note the mismatch between the us-led coalition s presence in syria and how it s present to the public . not only do they claim to be fight isi while at the same time indirectly help them , but they also call their attack on syrian army target defensive even though the syrian military have never attempt to attack any coalition force . and it be similarly ironic that these strike against the syrian military have occur in what the coalition call a deconfliction zone , where supposedly no conflict be allow . accord to security analyst charles shoebridge : these be self-declared [ u occupy ] zone of deconfliction . what they really mean there be that they be not allow other people to enter these zone , notwithstanding that this be part of a sovereign country , syria what they mean be that actually conflict be allow , and military force , as long a they be american , british and their rebel ally . they be not agree deconfliction zone . syria doesn t agree to them . russia , which of course have establish de-escalation zone elsewhere in the country , hasn t agree to this . consequently they really be , a [ russian foreign minister ] lavrov or his spokesman say , effectively unilateral zone . and not only be the narrative confusing , it be also not give the high priority among mainstream headline , with many other prominent story conveniently serve to occupy the public while the situation in al-tanf escalates . in a week that saw congressman shoot at and injure at a baseball practice , a massive tower block fire in london taking at least 17 life , and the uk election aftermath continue to be unresolved , one could easily remain unaware of the escalate situation around al-tanf in syria . with the us-led coalition now directly and deliberately attack syrian force , what have be a proxy war be suddenly grow more dangerous , and the prospect of a direct conflict between nuclear-armed power loom ever closer.as former british ambassador to syria peter ford remark during a recent conversation with 21wire , the british military have neither syrian approval to be in syria , nor international approval from the un , nor even legislative approval from it own parliament . the same applies to the united state ; although the u constitution give the power to declare war exclusively to congress , the u now have quite a long history of enter war or use deadly military force without congressional approval under the flexible guise of an authorization of force . more on this story from newsweek two syrian army tank destroy in a battle against moderate rebel , azaz , syria ( photo : christiaan triebert . source : wikicommons ) tom o connor newsweekrussia have demand that the you.s . stop attacking force that support the syrian government a they overtake position hold by the islamic state militant group ( isi ) on the country s border with iraq.russian foreign minister sergei lavrov reportedly make the comment saturday on a phone call with secretary of state rex tillerson , respond to three you.s . air strike in the past few week against force battle isi and other insurgent group on behalf of russian-backed syrian president bashar al-assad . the pentagon have argue that the pro-syrian government coalition , which it describe a iran-backed militia , have breach a deconfliction zone declare by the you.s.-led international coalition in southern syria but not recognize by moscow or damascus . lavrov criticize the you.s . s move , and the pair reportedly agree to cooperate more closely in the future . lavrov express his categorical disagreement with the you.s . strike on pro-government force and call on him to take concrete measure to prevent similar incident in future , russia s foreign ministry say in a statement , accord to reuters.while the syrian army and it ally , which include russia , iran and various pro-government militia , advance toward the besieged eastern city of deir al-zour , hold by isi since 2014 , the you.s . have deploy special force to train anti-assad rebel near the southern region of al-tanf . both faction be involve in the battle against isi but differ on syria s political future , with the former insisting that assad remain in power and the latter mostly advocate for his removal.continue this story at newsweekread more syria news at : 21st century wire syria filessupport our work by subscribe & become a member @ 21wire.tv",1,0,0.6900708407033356,0.30992915929666437

2583," i be voluntarily provide this statement , submit document , and sit for interview in order to she would light on issue that have be raise about my role in the trump for president campaign and during the transition period . i be not a person who have seek the spotlight . first in my business and now in public service , i have work on achieve goal , and have leave it to others to work on medium and public perception . because there have be a great deal of conjecture , speculation , and inaccurate information about me , i be grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight . my role in the trump for president campaign before join the administration , i work in the private sector , building and managing company . my experience be in business , not politics , and it be not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-law ’ s campaign when he decide to run for president . however , a the campaign progress , i be call on to assist with various task and aspect of the campaign , and take on more and more responsibility . over the course of the primary and general election campaign , my role continue to evolve . i ultimately work with the finance , scheduling , communication , speechwriting , polling , data and digital team , as well a become a point of contact for foreign government official . all of these be task that i have never perform on a campaign previously . when i be face with a new challenge , i would reach out to contact , ask advice , find the right person to manage the specific challenge , and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action . i be lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way , all of whom make significant contribution toward the campaign ’ s ultimate success . our nimble culture allow u to adjust to the ever-changing circumstance and make change on the fly a the situation warrant . i share this information because these action should be view through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousand of meeting and interaction , some of which be impactful and memorable and many of which be not . it be also important to note that a campaign ’ s success start with it message and it messenger . donald trump have the right vision for america and deliver his message perfectly . the result speak for themselves . not only do president trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponent and win the presidency ; he do so spend a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election . he outworked his opponent and run one of the best campaign in history use both modern technology and traditional method to bring his message to the american people . campaign contact with foreign person when it become apparent that my father-in-law be go to be the republican nominee for president , a normally happen , a number of official from foreign country attempt to reach out to the campaign . my father-in-law ask me to be a point of contact with these foreign country . these be not contact that i initiate , but , over the course of the campaign , i have incoming contact with people from approximately 15 country . to put these request in context , i must have receive thousand of call , letter and email from people look to talk or meet on a variety of issue and topic , include hundred from outside the united state . while i could not be responsive to everyone , i try to be respectful of any foreign government contact with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing , productive work relationship be the candidate to prevail . to that end , i call on a variety of people with deep experience , such a dr. henry kissinger , for advice on policy for the candidate , which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage , and what message would resonate . in addition , it be typical for me to receive 200 or more email a day during the campaign . i do not have the time to read every one , especially long emails from unknown sender or email chain to which i be add at some late point in the exchange . with respect to my contact with russia or russian representative during the campaign , there be hardly any . the first that i can recall be at the mayflower hotel in washington , d.c. in april 2016 . this be when then candidate trump be deliver a major foreign policy speech . do the event and speech have be my idea , and i oversee it execution . i arrive at the hotel early to make sure all logistics be in order . after that , i stop into the reception to thank the host of the event , dimitri simes , the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine , the national interest , who have do a great job put everything together . mr. simes and his group have create the guest list and extend the invitation for the event . he introduce me to several guest , among them four ambassador , include russian ambassador sergey kislyak . with all the ambassador , include mr. kislyak , we shake hand , exchange brief pleasantry and i thank them for attend the event and say i hop they would like candidate trump ’ s speech and his idea for a fresh approach to america ’ s foreign policy . the ambassador also express interest in create a positive relationship should we win the election . each exchange last less than a minute ; some give me their business card and invite me to lunch at their embassy . i never take them up on any of these invitation and that be the extent of the interaction . reuters news service have report that i have two call with ambassador kislyak at some time between april and november of 2016 . while i participate in thousand of call during this period , i do not recall any such call with the russian ambassador . we have review the phone record available to u and have not be able to identify any call to any number we know to be associate with ambassador kislyak and i be highly skeptical these call take place . a comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone record from the time do not reveal those call . i have no ongoing relationship with the ambassador before the election , and have limit knowledge about him then . in fact , on november 9 , the day after the election , i could not even remember the name of the russian ambassador . when the campaign receive an email purporting to be an official note of congratulation from president putin , i be ask how we could verify it be real . to do so i think the best way would be to ask the only contact i recall meeting from the russian government , which be the ambassador i have meet month earlier , so i send an email ask mr. simes , “ what be the name of the russian ambassador ? ” through my lawyer , i have ask reuters to provide the date on which the call supposedly occur or the phone number at which i supposedly reach , or be reach by , ambassador kislyak . the journalist refuse to provide any corroborate evidence that they occur . the only other russian contact during the campaign be one i do not recall at all until i be review document and email in response to congressional request for information . in june 2016 , my brother-in-law , donald trump jr. ask if i be free to stop by a meeting on june 9 at 3:00 p.m . the campaign be headquarter in the same building a his office in trump tower , and it be common for each of u to swing by the other ’ s meeting when request . he eventually send me his own email change the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. that email be on top of a long back and forth that i do not read at the time . a i do with most email when i be work remotely , i quickly review on my iphone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 pm at his office . document confirm my memory that this be calendar a “ meeting : don jr.| jar kushner. ” no one else be mention . i arrive at the meeting a little late . when i get there , the person who have since be identify a a russian attorney be talk about the issue of a ban on you.s . adoption of russian child . i have no idea why that topic be be raise and quickly determine that my time be not well-spent at this meeting . review email recently confirm my memory that the meeting be a waste of our time and that , in look for a polite way to leave and get back to my work , i actually email an assistant from the meeting after i have be there for ten or so minute and write “ can you pls call me on my cell ? need excuse to get out of meeting. ” i have not meet the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since . i think nothing more of this short meeting until it come to my attention recently . i do not read or recall this email exchange before it be show to me by my lawyer when review document for submission to the committee . no part of the meeting i attend include anything about the campaign , there be no follow up to the meeting that i be aware of , i do not recall how many people be there ( or their name ) , and i have no knowledge of any document be offer or accept . finally , after see the email , i disclose this meeting prior to it be report in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form , even if that be not require a meet the definition of the form . there be one more possible contact that i will note . on october 30 , 2016 , i receive a random email from the screenname “ guccifer400. ” this email , which i interpret a a hoax , be an extortion attempt and threaten to reveal candidate trump ’ s tax return and demand that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publish that information . i bring the email to the attention of a you.s . secret service agent on the plane we be all travel on and ask what he think . he advise me to ignore it and not to reply — which be what i do . the sender never contact me again . to the best of my recollection , these be the full extent of contact i have during the campaign with person who be or appear to potentially be representative of the russian government . transition contact with foreign person the transition period after the election be even more active than the campaign . start on election night , we begin to receive an incredible volume of message and invitation from well-wisher in the united state and abroad . dozen of message come from foreign official seek to set up foreign leader call and create line of communication and relationship with what would be the new administration . during this period , i recall have over fifty contact with people from over fifteen country . two of those meeting be with russian , neither of which i solicit . on november 16 , 2016 , my assistant receive a request for a meeting from the russian ambassador . a i mention before , previous to receive this request , i could not even recall the russian ambassador ’ s name , and have to ask for the name of the individual i have see at the mayflower hotel almost seven month earlier . in addition , far from be urgent , that meeting be not set up for two week — on december 1 . the meeting occur in trump tower , where we have our transition office , and last twenty- thirty minute . lt. general michael flynn ( ret . ) , who become the president ’ s national security advisor , also attend . during the meeting , after pleasantry be exchange , a i have do in many of the meeting i have and would have with foreign official , i state our desire for a fresh start in relation . also , a i have do in other meeting with foreign official , i ask ambassador kislyak if he would identify the best person ( whether the ambassador or someone else ) with whom to have direct discussion and who have contact with his president . the fact that i be ask about way to start a dialogue after election day should of course be view a strong evidence that i be not aware of one that exist before election day . the ambassador express similar sentiment about relation , and then say he especially want to address you.s . policy in syria , and that he want to convey information from what he call his “ generals. ” he say he want to provide information that would help inform the new administration . he say the general could not easily come to the you.s . to convey this information and he ask if there be a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation . general flynn or i explain that there be no such line . i believe develop a thoughtful approach on syria be a very high priority give the ongoing humanitarian crisis , and i ask if they have an exist communication channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmit the information they want to relay to general flynn . the ambassador say that would not be possible and so we all agree that we would receive this information after the inauguration . nothing else occur . i do not suggest a “ secret back channel. ” i do not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration take office . i do not raise the possibility of use the embassy or any other russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period . we do not discuss sanction . approximately a week later , on december 6 , the embassy ask if i could meet with the ambassador on december 7 . i decline . they then ask if i could meet on december 6 ; i decline again . they then ask when the early be that i could meet . i decline these request because i be work on many other responsibility for the transition . he ask if he could meet my assistant instead and , to avoid offend the ambassador , i agree . he do so on december 12 . my assistant report that the ambassador have request that i meet with a person name sergey gorkov who he say be a banker and someone with a direct line to the russian president who could give insight into how putin be view the new administration and best way to work together . i agree to meet mr. gorkov because the ambassador have be so insistent , say he have a direct relationship with the president , and because mr. gorkov be only in new york for a couple day . i make room on my schedule for the meeting that occur the next day , on december 13 . the meeting with mr. gorkov last twenty to twenty-five minute . he introduce himself and give me two gift — one be a piece of art from nvgorod , the village where my grandparent be from in belarus , and the other be a bag of dirt from that same village .

my assistant interpret that message a meaning that the entire form be complete . at that point , the form be a rough draft and still have many omission include not list any foreign government contact and even omit the address of my father-in-law ( which be obviously well know ) . because of this miscommunication , my assistant submit the draft on january 18 , 2017 . that evening , when we realize the form have be submit prematurely , we inform the transition team that we need to make change and addition to the form . the very next day , january 19 , 2017 , we submit supplemental information to the transition , which confirm receipt and say they would immediately transmit it to the fbi . the supplement disclose that i have “ numerous contact with foreign official ” and that we be go through my record to provide an accurate and complete list . i provide a list of those contact in the normal course , before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiry or medium report about my form . it have be report that my submission omit only contact with russian . that be not the case . in the accidental early submission of the form , all foreign contact be omit . the supplemental information later disclose over one hundred contact from more than twenty country that might be responsive to the question on the form . these include meeting with individual such a jordan ’ s king abdullah ii , israel ’ s prime minister bibi netanyahu , mexico ’ s secretary of foreign affair , luis videgaray caso and many more . all of these have be leave off before . over the last six month , i have make every effort to provide the fbi with whatever information be need to investigate my background . in addition , my attorney have explain that the security clearance process be one in which supplement be expect and invite . the form itself instruct that , during the interview , the information in the document can be “ update ( d ) , clarif ( ied ) , and explain ( ed ) ” a part of the security clearance process . a good example be the june 9 meeting . for reason that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting i have provide , i do not remember the meeting and certainly do not remember it a one with anyone who have to be include on an sf-86 . when document review for production in connection with committee request remind me that meeting have occur , and because of the language in the email chain that i then read for the first time , i include that meet on a supplement . i do so even though my attorney be unable to conclude that the russian lawyer be a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form . this supplemental information be also provide voluntarily , well prior to any medium inquiry , report or request for this information , and it be do soon after i be remind of the meeting . a i have say from the very first medium inquiry , i be happy to share information with the investigate body . i have show today that i be willing to do so and will continue to cooperate a i have nothing to hide . a i indicate , i know there have be a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contact with any official or people from russia . i have disclose these contact and describe them as fully a i can recall . the record and document i be provide will show that i have perhaps four contact with russian representative out of thousand during the campaign and transition , none of which be impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable . i be very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight . i also have try to provide context for my role in the campaign , and i be proud of the candidate that we support , of the campaign that we run , and the victory that we achieve . it have be my practice not to appear in the medium or leak information in my own defense . i have try to focus on the important work at hand and serve this president and this country to the best of my ability . i hope that through my answer to question , write statement and document i have now be able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contact with russian representative during the campaign and transition . i do not collude , nor know of anyone else in the campaign who collude , with any foreign government . i have no improper contact . i have not rely on russian fund to finance my business activity in the private sector . i have try to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my sf-86 form , above and beyond what be require . hopefully , this put these matter to rest .",0,1,0.39130734734767414,0.6086926526523259
35575,"21 in cleveland for the republican and july 25-28 in philadelphia for the democrats.like so many thing in politics , there be twist and turn in how the popular vote be use to select each party s candidate.the following be a guide to the nominating process : q : be the delegate selection process the same for the republican and democratic party ? a : no . the party set their own rule . one thing that be the same be that at each party convention , a candidate need to reach only a simple majority of the delegate vote to win the nomination.q : how many delegate be there ? a : the democratic convention will be attend by about 4,763 delegate , with 2,382 delegate need to win the nomination . the republican convention will be attend by 2,472 delegate , with 1,237 delegate need to win.q : i keep hear about superdelegates . be they different from other delegate ? do both the republican and democrat have superdelegates ? a : superdelegates , officially know a unpledged delegate , be a sort of wild card in the nominating process , but only the democrat have them.the category be create for the 1984 democratic convention , and accord to political scientist , they be a legacy of the 1980 convention when there be a fight for the nomination between president jimmy carter , who be seek a second term in the white house , and senator edward kennedy of massachusetts . member of congress be frustrate by their lack of influence , because delegate elect to support one candidate could not switch to support another . so democratic member of the house of representative lead an effort to win a role for themselves . that result in the creation of superdelegates . unlike other delegate , superdelegates may change what candidate they be support right up to the convention.there be no fixed number of superdelegates because the group be define by various category whose member change from one election cycle to another . here be who get to be a superdelegate : all democratic member of the house of representative and the senate ; the democratic governor ; the democratic president and vice president of the united state ; former democratic president and vice president ; former democratic leader of the you.s . senate ; former democratic speaker of the house and former democratic minority leader . throw in the member of the democratic national committee and the former chair of the dnc and you finally have the whole pool of superdelegates.q : what about the other delegate ? do they get to choose which candidate to support ? a : both the democratic and republican party send delegate to their convention base on the popular vote in the primary election and caucus hold in each of the 50 state . but the party have different rule on how delegate be allot to a candidate.the democratic party applies uniform rule to all state . in each state , delegate be allocate in proportion to the percentage of the primary or caucus vote in each district . but a candidate must win at least 15 percent of the vote to be allocate any delegates.the republican party let u state determine their own rule , although it do dictate some thing . some state award delegate proportionate to the popular vote , although most such state have a minimum percentage that a candidate must reach to win any delegate . some other state use the winner-take-all method , in which the candidate with the high percentage of the popular vote be award all the delegate . other state use a combination of the two methods.states that use the proportionate method may instead use the winner-take-all method if one candidate win more than 50 percent of the popular vote.in addition , the republican party require that all state with nominating contest hold between march 1 and march 14 use the proportional method , mean that all the state hold vote on super tuesday will have to award delegate proportionally.q : what happen to delegate if a candidate drop out of the race ? a : another good question , because we have certainly see that happen this year.for the democratic party , in every state , delegate be reallocate to the remain candidates.nomination about delegate , not votesthe power broker of the democrat party be not about to let crazy uncle bernie represent them in the presidential election this year . he be anxious to flatten the economic map in the nation and go much far than obama have in steal from the rich and destroy the wealth generate engine of the country . perhaps the elite wish thing to do down a bit differently than what sander have in mind.it turn out that the new hampshire primary , which bernie win in a landslide , will probably award him few delegate than hillary receives.sanders win 60 percent of the vote , but thanks to the democratic party s nominate system , he leave the granite state with at least 13 delegate while she leave with at least 15 delegates.new hampshire have 24 pledge delegate , which be allot base on the popular vote . sander have 13 , and clinton have 9 , with 2 currently allot to neither.under democratic national committee rule , new hampshire also have 8 superdelegates , party official who be free to commit to whomever they like , regardless of how their state vote . their vote count the same a delegate win through the primary.new hampshire have 8 superdelegates , 6 of which be commit to hillary clinton , give her a total of 15 delegate from new hampshire a of wednesday at 9 a.m.the two remain superdelegates remain uncommitted , so hillary actually come out ahead in overall delegate count . clinton have 394 delegate that include both super delegate and one that be pick up in primary election , while bernie now have only 42 . in other word the fix be in , and clinton will absolutely be the democrat nominee for president unless she be indict for her illegal act deal with top secret government documents.but a with the assigning of delegate , it seem that the will of the people , along with their clearly declare vote , will be ignore and the coronation will still take place . a some of my friend like to say , hillary for prison , 2016 ! may it be so.for the republican party , it vary by state . in some state , delegate be require to stick with their original candidate at least through the first ballot at the republican national convention . in some other state , if a candidate drop out , his or her delegate may immediately pledge to another candidate . there be also a middle ground in which those delegate be reallocate to the remain candidate . via : nypost",1,0,0.7101391816677552,0.28986081833224475
